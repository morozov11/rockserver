# Task log

## RS-000 — 2026-08-13 — Repository bootstrap

- Goal: establish the Rust crate, repository hygiene, contributor guidance, project scope, architecture outline, and near-term roadmap.
- Scope: Rust edition 2024 bootstrap binary and documentation only.
- Result: completed by commit `4117786` (`Document RockServer project setup`); the commit added the crate files, ignore rules, contributor instructions, README, TODO, and architecture outline.
- Checks: the commit and resulting files were inspected for this log entry; historical command output is not available in Git and is therefore not claimed.
- Status: complete.

## RS-001 — 2026-08-13 — HTTP service skeleton

- Goal: introduce a minimal, testable Axum HTTP service with operational health endpoints.
- Scope: library plus thin binary, stable JSON health models, request and application tracing, configurable local listener, Ctrl+C graceful shutdown, in-memory router tests, and project documentation. Search, OpenAPI, persistence, containers, external providers, and client work are excluded.
- Result: added the Axum library application and thin binary, liveness and readiness routes with a shared stable serde model, JSON application tracing and HTTP request spans, `ROCKSERVER_BIND_ADDR` configuration with the local-only `127.0.0.1:3000` default, an extensible graceful-serving boundary with Ctrl+C as the current signal, and in-memory router tests. Updated the contributor rules and current project documentation.
- Checks: `cargo fmt --check` passed; `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passed; `cargo test` passed with 2 tests; `git diff --check` passed.
- Status: complete.
